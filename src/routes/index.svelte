  </p>
  <h2>The main key features of Ps Touch Apk</h2>
  <p>Lets talk about there key features of Ps Touch Apk :</p>
  <h3>1. The simplified interface and easy to use</h3>
  <p>

    the positions of the toolbars. Also, the app&rsquo;s interface has been
    redesigned to be more friendly for mobile as well as helps them easily
    operate on the touch screen. Most users can remember each location of
    editing tools after several uses. Besides, the interface is displayed in the
    same horizontal direction as on the PC. There is a difference between a
    smartphone and a tablet.
  </p>
  <h3>2. Change the color of the object</h3>
  <p>
    This feature helps you change the color of the object in the photo without
    affecting its details. You should choose monochromatic areas and not be
    blended by other colors. For example, you can change your blue shirt to red
    or change your black hairstyle to a more prominent color like red or green.
    It is very easy. Please see the instruction below:
  </p>
  <p>
    First, users need to use the Magic Wand tool and touch the color area that
    you want to change. After that, you change the Tolerance index to 50 to
    prevent edge artifacts. If you use a small screen phone, you may have
    difficulty dragging the slider to an exact indicator. At this point, you can
    touch the number section and use the numeric keypad to type. To do this, you
    can access &ldquo;Adjustments -&gt; Colour Balance and drag the Red, Green
    and Blue sliders to select new colors for the subject.
  </p>

    should be in the transparent form.
  </p>

  <p>

    photos into unique artistic photos. You can check out these tools at

    were created more than 100 years ago. By combining Sunny Afternoon and Old
    Sepia effects in the Effects section, you will quickly have an old photo to
    post on social networks and show off to your friends.
  </p>
  <h3>7. Clean up background</h3>
  <p>

    you want. You can do this by using the Feather and Inverse tools in the
    Select section.
  </p>
  <h3>8. Add text</h3>
  <p>
    Adding text to images is a basic feature, which is almost available on all
    photo editing applications today. This feature will help users to mark
    copyright or simply send a congratulatory message to their friends. With
    Adobe Photoshop Touch, users can easily add text by creating a text layer.
    You just click on the text field to change the text. Besides, the
    application also allows users to change the font, size, text color and add
    shadow or other effects to the text.
  </p>
  <h3>9. Detailed guideline</h3>
  <p>
    If you have never used any similar editing applications before, you may have
    some difficulty. To be able to create a complete image, users need to use a
    combination of tools together as well as some adjustment parameters. This
    can be a challenge for inexperienced users.
  </p>
  <p>
    Understanding this, the developer
    <a href="https://www.adobe.com/in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe</a>
    has integrated a detailed instruction right from the home screen so that you
    can access them at any time. Many people still believe that the instructions
    included in Tutorials are all features of the application. But these are
    just suggestions to help users make good modifications. You can completely
    create new changes by changing the editing parameters or using different
    tools together.
